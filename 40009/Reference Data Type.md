A [[Class]] is a reference [[Data Type|DT]]
- the possible values of a class are its [[Instance Objects]]
- the data representation is a [[Reference]] to a block of memory in the [[Heap]]

Classes are organised in packages.

Each user-defined [[Class]] extends [[Java]] with a new reference [[Data Type|DT]].
