### What is a list
A list is an [[Abstract Data Type]] and [[Linear Data Structure]] representing a sequence of an arbitrary number of elements ordered by position.

### Operations
- create an empty list
- test if empty
- obtain size
- get and element from anywhere in the list
- add an element anywhere in the list
- remove an element anywhere in the list

### Design Decisions
- [[Array]]
	- how do you use arrays?
	- which operations are efficient?
- [[Linked List]]
	- how do you represent nodes?
	- how do you link the elements together?
- Does it need to be ordered?

### Array-based implementation
- use an array to store the elements
- need to specify the length on creation
