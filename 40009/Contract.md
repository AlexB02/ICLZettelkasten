### Definition
A contract in [[Java]] defines the [[Functional Interface]] of an [[Abstract Data Type]], listing its required constructors and methods.

### Specifying contracts
- Natural language
	 - useful for API documantation, usually imprecise
 -  Formal languages (JML)
    - precise and (kind of) verifiable, but limited expressiveness and wordy
- Test suite ([[JUnit]])
	- usually a good compromise
- Contracts must be maintained
