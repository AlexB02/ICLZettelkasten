### Definition
Transitive closure of a binary relation R on a set X is the smallest relation on X that contains R and is [[Transitive]].

let $R^k = R\circ...\circ R$ k times.

 $$R^+ = \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} R^{k}$$
 
 or, if X is finite and $\left|X\right|= n$ then,
 
 $$R^+ = \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{n} R^k$$

If *R* is transitive then $R^+ = R$.
