### What is the Travelling Salesman Problem?
#madecard
Find a tour of N cities in a country (assuming all cities to be visited are reachable), the tour should visit every city just once, return to the starting point and be of minimum distance.

Can be solved by using [[Bellman-Held-Karp Algorithm]] in $O(V^22^V)$.

The TSP is an extension of the [[Hamiltonian Circuit Problem]].
